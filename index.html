  Across millennia, prosthetics have been used by humans to bring back at least partial limb functionality artificially to an individual.
  This could have been done for many reasons centuries or even millennia ago- maybe to allow an individual to pull their weight in society 
  and prevent them from being a burden, or maybe simply to help them fit in more. Today the main purpose of prosthetics is not just to return 
  some sort of limb functionality, but also to improve an individual’s general quality of life, be it for physical or mental reasons. However, 
  the conclusion of this article is that there are still many problems and issues that scientists and engineers need to overcome to make
  advanced prosthetics closer replicate the abilities and functionality that an organic limb can provide and make them commercially available
  and affordable.

 “An estimated 15,900 upper limb amputations are performed in the USA each year, and ~6,300 in the EU (Malešević, N. & Antfolk, C. 2024)”. 
 The development and improvement of sensory feedback technologies in prosthetic limbs would not only help thousands of people every year improve
 the physical aspects of their lives, but also mental and emotional aspects. A recent study shows that out of 100 amputees seeking treatment,
 depression affected 67% of them and anxiety affected 33% (Phutane, P. et al. 2024), this highlights the mental and emotional suffering faced 
 by amputees that could be prevented by advancements in prosthetic technologies making them more affordable and acquirable. However,
 “several hurdles remain in the development of upper limb prostheses that provide sensory feedback (Malešević, N. & Antfolk, C. 2024)” and this 
 article aims to explore the difficulties in development advanced prosthetics with sensory feedback.

 “There is evidence of the use of prostheses from the times of the ancient Egyptians. (Thurston, A. J. 2007)” highlighting the importance and the 
 value, be it societal or personal, of at least partial limb functionality throughout generations and in different civilisations. These prosthetics, 
 when compared to ones of today, are crude and likely not too efficient at their function due to the use of heavy or brittle materials or just materials 
 that today would seem impractical as a whole, examples of this include prosthetic legs fabricated from iron from between 3500 and 1800 BC (Thurston, A. J. 2007).
 Today’s prosthetics are designed to be more practical and efficient because of the huge number of different materials available to designers and
 engineers today than in ancient times, however, the development of advanced prosthetics with functionality and sensory feedback comparable to
 natural limbs is slow despite many breakthroughs made in this field. This could be because “the necessity for natural sensation is under scrutiny
 — functionality might ultimately outweigh the need for natural-feeling feedback (Malešević, N. & Antfolk, C. 2024)” suggesting that the number of 
 qualified individuals thinking that working on developing natural sensory feedback in prosthetics is worthwhile as of right now is small. Furthermore,
 there are still numerous challenges and “Overall, the field requires innovative technological development and a deep understanding of user-specific
 needs to make advanced prosthetic solutions both sophisticated and practical for everyday use. (Malešević, N. & Antfolk, C. 2024)” so that effective 
 and practical advanced prosthetics with sensory feedback could be developed on a large scale. One of these challenges is in providing “A prosthetic
 hand with sensory feedback that closely imitates that of an intact hand (Malešević, N. & Antfolk, C. 2024)” because the human hand contains more than
 60,000 sensory axons (Malešević, N. & Antfolk, C. 2024). This means that creating a prosthetic hand that can closely mimic that of a biological one is
 going to require the research, funding and development of sensors that can cover the entire prosthesis. One such technology being researched is 
 “electronic skin that could enable complete sensory mimicry of the human hand (Malešević, N. & Antfolk, C. 2024)”, however the amount of time it will 
 take to successfully develop such technology is unknown and could take a very long time as testing of sensory feedback in prosthetics has already been 
 going on for 50 years (Malešević, N. & Antfolk, C. 2024). The fact that it is taking this long to create prosthetics with sensory feedback shows just 
 how intricate and incredible the human nervous system is if scientists have been struggling to replicate what the sensory neurones do artificially for 
 this long and still cannot effectively do it.

 “Advanced robotic hands or multifingered prostheses are nowadays available to a wide audience of researchers. Therefore, it is expected that studies using 
 physical devices and focusing on the contribution of sensory feedback to the performance of functional activities will be carried out more frequently.
 (Antfolk, C., D'Alonzo, M., Rosén, B., Lundborg, G., Sebelius, F. & Cipriani, C. 2013)”. These studies mentioned would be best focused on sensors embedded 
 in the prostheses identifying information to deliver to the user’s peripheral nervous system (Antfolk, C., D'Alonzo, M., Rosén, B., Lundborg, G., Sebelius,
 F. & Cipriani, C. 2013), however, one of the biggest issues is that none of the widely available advanced prosthetics are designed to harbour sensory 
 feedback capabilities (Antfolk, C., D'Alonzo, M., Rosén, B., Lundborg, G., Sebelius, F. & Cipriani, C. 2013). This shows how commercial availability of 
 advanced prosthetics with the capability to mimic sensations felt by organic limbs is no-where near being ready to become a reality.
